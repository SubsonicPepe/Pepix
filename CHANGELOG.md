**Date:** 2025-10-02  

### Added
- Expanded **README.md** "New News" section with ongoing updates.  
- Added **Addendum Proposal v0.x — Early Creator Program**, introducing a framework for whitelisted community creators after Pepix69 and Advisory Council formation.  
- Drafted **Future Allocation of Earmarked Funds Proposal**:

  - Possible future allocation includes contributions to the **Pepecoin Foundation** or other community-aligned charitable initiatives.  
  - Final decision to be determined by community governance vote.  

### Notes

### Next Steps
