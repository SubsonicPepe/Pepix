Each inscription includes:

## üë• Community and Governance
- Governance takes place in the official **Pepix Pond Discord** server  
- Votes are **weighted by collector holdings** with an anti-whale mechanism:  
  - Top 5 Pepix in a collection = full weight  
  - Remaining Pepix = 50% weight

- These honorary Pepix are **non-transferable**  
- Any attempt to trade or transfer results in permanent **blacklisting** from the catalogue
