# Pepix Whitepaper v0.9
Timestamp: September 30, 2025 — 02:55 UTC

## Project Overview
Pepix is a limited, pixel-art collection inscribed on the Pepecoin blockchain, blending meme culture, 8-bit artistry, and rarity-driven mechanics. Each Pepix is generated from a base template with custom layers and accessories, ranging from simple (rarity 1) to ultra-legendary one-of-one masterpieces (rarity 10).

Every Pepix is a static pixel sprite — uniform in pose, uniform in scale — with uniqueness expressed only through layered traits, skin variations, backgrounds, and rare props. This ensures maximum consistency while preserving scarcity and originality.

## Artistic Authorship and Sustainability
All Pepix sprites are handcrafted through digital art by the creator, Subsonic_Ᵽepe.  
At least 50% of all proceeds from sales are allocated toward minting and raising base inscription fees for new Pepix sprites. This ensures growth remains sustainable and aligned with community interests.

## Minting and Inscription Fees
**Base Inscription Fee (Image + Cryptic Text):** 420 PEPE  
Includes both Pepix artwork and its associated cryptic inscription, permanently etched on-chain.  
Ultra-legendary traits are permanently locked after first use and never reused.

## Trait System
- **Accessories:** Hats, spectacles, necklaces, cigarettes, tops (hoodie, robe, t-shirt, sweater, etc.)  
- **Backgrounds:** Flat colors, gradients, patterns, or unique cosmic backdrops  
- **Skin Tones:** Base green + rare variants (neon glow, shadow black, radiant gold, etc.)  
- **Props:** Static external objects (staves, weapons, companions, etc.)  
- **Eyes and Expressions:** Neutral, sleepy, angry, glowing, laughing, etc.  

**Ultra-Legendary Rule:** Any trait used in a Pepix 10/10 rarity is permanently retired and cannot be reused.

## Verification and Provenance
Genuine Pepix are only inscribed through the Pepix Creator Address:  
**PiZntAfTuqPEiBgovFtPJQrLZ9GTFi77xx**  

Every Pepix consists of:  
1. The image file inscription  
2. The cryptic text inscription  

Both are permanently on-chain and verifiable through the Creator Address.

### Verification Process (Updated v0.9)
To gain the Pepix Holder role and access to exclusive community channels:

1. Submit a request in **#ready2verify** with this format:  
   `PEPIX-VERIFY-<PepixID>-<DiscordHandle>`  
   Example: `PEPIX-VERIFY-Pepix7-@CoolFrog#1234`  
2. You will be assigned a unique **nonce dust amount** (a tiny PEPE amount).  
3. Send the **nonce dust amount** from the wallet holding your Pepix → Creator Wallet.  
4. Post your TxID in **#verification**.  
5. Once confirmed, you’ll receive the Pepix Holder role.

**TL;DR:** Request verification → receive nonce → send dust → post TxID → verified.

This process ensures on-chain verifiable ownership without memos, file transfers, or signing requirements.

## Supply and Governance
The Pepix supply is capped at **4,269 Pepix sprites** with matching text inscriptions.  
Honorary Pepix gifted during the special period are excluded from this cap.  

The supply timeline is flexible, determined by:  
- Market value of PEPE  
- Creator resources  
- Community involvement (sales and demand)  

If no Pepix are sold, production pauses to avoid unnecessary resource consumption and blockchain congestion.  

**Base Inscription Fee:** 420 PEPE per Pepix  
**Total inscription fees for full capped supply:** 1,792,980 PEPE  

### Transfer of Ownership & Re-Verification
- All Pepix sales must be announced in **#sales-channel** with TxID for provenance.  
- New holders must complete verification (see process above).  
- Collectors upgrading rarity (buying higher-tier Pepix) may request **re-verification** to adjust their Discord role.  

### Decentralized Creation Roadmap
After **Pepix420**, select community creators may be invited to add new Pepix sprites. Rules will be provided in a private channel, including base files and trait catalogues.  

New Pepix must meet all standards:  
- Correct image size  
- Valid base + accessories  
- Proper inscription fee  

Approved Pepix are catalogued under the new creator’s address, preserving provenance.  
Supply cap remains 4,269. Pepix beyond this cap are considered **Novelty Pepix** and are not catalogued.
