# Pepix Whitepaper v0.6

Timestamp: September 29, 2025 — 15:13 UTC

## Project Overview

Pepix is a limited, pixel-art collection inscribed on the Pepecoin blockchain, blending meme culture, 8-bit artistry, and rarity-driven mechanics. Each Pepix is generated from a base template with custom layers and accessories, ranging from simple (rarity 1) to ultra-legendary one-of-one masterpieces (rarity 10).
Every Pepix is a static pixel sprite uniform in pose, uniform in scale with uniqueness expressed only through layered traits, skin variations, backgrounds, and rare props. This ensures maximum consistency while preserving scarcity and originality.

## Artistic Authorship and Sustainability

All Pepix sprites are handcrafted through digital art by the creator, Subsonic_Ᵽepe. This ensures that every Pepix is designed with direct creative intention and consistency.
At least 50 percent of all proceeds from sales will be allocated toward minting and raising base inscription fees for new Pepix sprites. The specific use of these funds will be guided by community decisions, ensuring that growth and expansion remain sustainable and aligned with collector interests.

## Minting and Inscription Fees

Base Inscription Fee (Image + Cryptic Text): 420 PEPE
Includes: Pepix artwork + associated cryptic inscription permanently etched on-chain.
Ultra-legendary traits are locked permanently after first use (never reused).

Skin Tones: Base green + rare variants (neon glow, shadow black, radiant gold, etc.)
Props: Static external objects (staves, weapons, companions, etc.)
Eyes and Expressions: Neutral, sleepy, angry, glowing, laughing, etc.
Ultra-Legendary Rule: Any trait used in a Pepix 10/10 rarity is permanently retired and cannot be reused.

## Verification and Provenance

Genuine Pepix are only inscribed through the Pepix Creator Address:
PiZntAfTuqPEiBgovFtPJQrLZ9GTFi77xx
Every inscription includes both:
1. The image file of the Pepix
2. The cryptic text inscription, catalogued alongside the Pepix by Tx ID
Both the artwork and cryptic text inscription are verifiable on-chain through the Creator Address
Collectors will be asked for the cryptic inscription text associated with their Pepix as verification of authenticity

## Verification Process

Step 1: Purchase a genuine Pepix through official listings.
Step 2: Within 24–48 hours you will receive the cryptic text inscription associated with your Pepix.
Step 3: Send this inscription back to Subsonic_Ᵽepe. This step is vital for Discord role verification.
Step 4: If a resale occurs, the seller must notify the sales-channel and the verification process is repeated with the new buyer.
Step 5: After verification is complete, the inscription is returned to the holder. Only verified holders are granted the Pepix Holder role in Discord.

## Supply and Governance

The Pepix supply will be capped at 4,269 Pepix sprites and their matching text inscriptions. This cap does not include honorary Pepix sprites, which are gifted directly from the Creator Wallet and require no verification.
The timeline for filling this supply will be flexible and determined by:
- The market value of PEPE
- Creator resources
- Community involvement through the purchase of Pepix
If no Pepix are sold, there is no need to continue creating and inscribing more, as this would consume both creator and community resources while adding congestion to the blockchain network.
Base Inscription Fee: 420 PEPE per Pepix
Total inscription fees for full capped supply = 1,792,980 PEPE

## Addendum v0.1

Catalogue Release
After the successful inscription of Pepix15, the full catalogue of accessories and their rarities will be publicly released.
This catalogue will provide transparency for collectors, showing both the common and rare trait pools, as well as officially retired ultra-legendary traits.
Community Governance
Specific details regarding:
- The total supply of Pepix
- Adjustments to future floor price listings
Will be determined by community votes hosted in the official Pepix Pond Discord server

## Addendum v0.2 — Honorary Pepix Gifting Period

After the successful inscription of Pepix15, and before Pepix16, there will be a period of gifting several rarity 8–10 Pepix to key Pepecoin community members including founders, developers, and moderators (1 each, customizable upon request).
Rules:
- Honorary Pepix are non-transferable and excluded from the collectible supply
- Any attempt to sell or transfer an honorary Pepix will result in both the Pepix and the original holder being blacklisted from the catalogue
- The gifting period will last 30 days from the Tx ID timestamp of Pepix15
- First 14 days: eligible members must respond via Discord/X to redeem and customize
- Remaining 16 days: Pepix will be handcrafted and inscribed
- All unsold Pepix from the Creator Wallet will be unlisted during this period

## Addendum v0.3 — Weighted Collector Voting

Community votes on project direction, inscription fees, and floor prices will be weighted based on total Pepix collection value held by each collector.
- The top 5 Pepix by rarity in a collection will count at full weight
- All other Pepix in the collection will be weighted at 50 percent value
This anti-whale mechanism ensures that major collectors maintain influence but cannot dominate decision-making at the expense of broader community input.

## Trust Playbook

Pepix is built to be rug-resistant by embedding accountability and transparency into the project from day one.
Wallet Transparency:
- All Pepix inscriptions come from the Creator Wallet only: PiZntAfTuqPEiBgovFtPJQrLZ9GTFi77xx
- No side wallets or stealth mints ever.
Public Accounting:
- A monthly report will be released listing Pepix created and inscription fees used. Reports are verifiable on-chain and published on GitHub and Discord.
Immutable Supply & Traits:
- Supply permanently capped at 4,269 Pepix (excluding honorary gifts).
- Traits and props are catalogued for collector reference. Ultra-Legendary traits retired after first use.
No Stealth Mints:
- Every Pepix is announced before inscription with description and expected fees. TxIDs updated after successful inscription.
Community Oversight:
- After 15 holders, an Advisory Council will be elected to observe creator wallet transactions.
Open Audits:
- Independent 3rd party audits are welcomed at any time.

## Creator Wallet Policy

The official Pepix Creator Wallet address is: PiZntAfTuqPEiBgovFtPJQrLZ9GTFi77xx
- 50% of all Pepix sales are earmarked for inscription fees. These funds remain in the Creator Wallet until used for Pepix inscriptions or chain costs.
- Earmarked funds are never diverted off-project.
What this means for holders:
- Every sale directly supports new Pepix inscriptions and community growth.
- Collectors can independently verify usage on-chain.
Next Steps:
- After council election, the wallet will transition to multi-sig.
- Auto-split mechanics may be added if supported by the Pepecoin network to automate earmarked funds distribution.
