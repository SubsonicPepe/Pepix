## Step 1: Send a Dust Transaction
From the wallet that currently holds your Pepix:

- Send **0.001 PEPE** (dust amount) to the official Creator Wallet:

- In the **memo / message field**, include the following format:  
PEPIX-VERIFY-<PepixID>-<your Discord handle>-<nonce>

Example:

The `<nonce>` will be provided when you request verification.

## Step 2: Submit Your Proof
- After sending the transaction, copy the **TxID**.  
- Post it in the `#verification` channel on Discord.  

The Creator team will manually check that:  
1. The Tx originated from the wallet holding your Pepix.  
2. The memo matches your Pepix ID and Discord handle.

## Step 3: Get Verified
Once confirmed, you will be granted the **Pepix Holder** role.  

- You’ll unlock the **Lilypad** and other exclusive channels.  
- If your Pepix includes a private cryptic text inscription, it will be sent to you after verification.  
- If you later sell your Pepix, the buyer must repeat this process.

  `PEPIX-VERIFY-<ID>-<discord>-<nonce>`
