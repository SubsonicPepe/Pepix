# Pepix Trust Playbook  

The Pepix project is built with transparency and collector trust as its foundation.  
This playbook outlines the safeguards and commitments that make Pepix **rug-resistant**.

## ðŸ”‘ Wallet Transparency  

- All Pepix inscriptions originate **only** from the official Creator Wallet:  PiZntAfTuqPEiBgovFtPJQrLZ9GTFi77xx

  - No side wallets, hidden mints, or off-chain asset generation will ever be used.  
- Collectors can independently verify **all provenance and history** on-chain by reviewing transactions tied to this wallet.
- After the Advisory Council is elected, A new wallet will be made specifically to store the 50% earmarked sales for Pepix inscription fees. The Advisory Council (and any curious member really) will have read-only oversight to make sure funds are being allocated correctly. As the project grows, new trust measures will be implemented (ie. Multi-Sig wallets, Escrow contract, etc)

## ðŸ“Š Public Accounting  

- Each month, the creator will publish a **public report** that is verifiable on-chain.  
- Reports will list:  
- Pepix created during that month  
- Associated inscription fees (420 PEPE per Pepix)  
- These reports will be:  
- Published on GitHub  
- Published on Discord  
- Permanently linked to on-chain activity for transparency  
- **No stealth mints**: all Pepix inscriptions will be **announced in advance** with:  
- Word description  
- Expected transaction fees  
- TxID (added to catalogue after successful inscription)  

---

## ðŸ“¦ Immutable Supply & Traits  

- The total Pepix supply is **permanently capped** at:  
**4,269 Pepix** (plus honorary Pepix, which are outside of circulation)  
- This number will **never be increased or decreased**.  
- All traits and props are (or will be) catalogued in the [Traits Catalogue](TraitsCatalogue.md) for collector reference.  
- Ultra-Legendary traits are permanently retired after first use.  

---

## ðŸ‘¥ Community Oversight  

- Once the community reaches **15 verified Pepix holders**, voting will begin for an **Advisory Council**.  
- The council will consist of elected community members who act as **observers** of blockchain transactions tied to the creator wallet.  
- Council members will not have minting control but will serve as public accountability representatives.

## ðŸ”Ž 3rd Party Audits  

- The Pepix project remains open to **independent, third-party audits** of:  
- Smart inscription processes  
- Wallet provenance  
- Catalogue consistency  
- Auditors and researchers are invited to review and report findings at any time.
