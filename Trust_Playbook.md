# Pepix Trust Playbook  

The Pepix project is built with transparency and collector trust as its foundation.  
This playbook outlines the safeguards and commitments that make Pepix **rug-resistant**.  

---

## ðŸ”‘ Wallet Transparency  

- All Pepix inscriptions originate **only** from the official Creator Wallet:  PiZntAfTuqPEiBgovFtPJQrLZ9GTFi77xx

  - No side wallets, hidden mints, or off-chain asset generation will ever be used.  
- Collectors can independently verify **all provenance and history** on-chain by reviewing transactions tied to this wallet.
- After the Advisory Council is elected, A new wallet will be made specifically to store the 50% earmarked sales for Pepix inscription fees. The Advisory Council (and any curious member really) will have read-only oversight to make sure funds are being allocated correctly. As the project grows, new trust measures will be implemented (ie. Multi-Sig wallets, Escrow contract, etc)

## ðŸ“Š Public Accounting  

- Each month, the creator will publish a **public report** that is verifiable on-chain.  
- Reports will list:  
- Pepix created during that month  
- Associated inscription fees (420 PEPE per Pepix)  
- These reports will be:  
- Published on GitHub  
- Published on Discord  
- Permanently linked to on-chain activity for transparency  
- **No stealth mints**: all Pepix inscriptions will be **announced in advance** with:  
- Word description  
- Expected transaction fees  
- TxID (added to catalogue after successful inscription)  

---

## ðŸ“¦ Immutable Supply & Traits  

- The total Pepix supply is **permanently capped** at:  
**4,269 Pepix** (plus honorary Pepix, which are outside of circulation)  
- This number will **never be increased or decreased**.  
- All traits and props are (or will be) catalogued in the [Traits Catalogue](TRAITS.md) for collector reference.  
- Ultra-Legendary traits are permanently retired after first use.  

---

## ðŸ‘¥ Community Oversight  

- Once the community reaches **15 verified Pepix holders**, voting will begin for an **Advisory Council**.  
- The council will consist of elected community members who act as **observers** of blockchain transactions tied to the creator wallet.  
- Council members will not have minting control but will serve as public accountability representatives.  

---

## ðŸ”Ž 3rd Party Audits  

- The Pepix project remains open to **independent, third-party audits** of:  
- Smart inscription processes  
- Wallet provenance  
- Catalogue consistency  
- Auditors and researchers are invited to review and report findings at any time.  

---

## ðŸ“Œ Summary Commitments  

- One wallet only: **no hidden mints**  
- Monthly **on-chain verified reports**  
- Immutable supply of **4,269 Pepix**  
- No stealth mints, every Pepix is **announced before inscription**  
- Advisory council after 15 holders for community oversight  
- Open invitation for **independent audits**  

# ðŸ“¢ Pepix Creator Inscription Wallet  

Transparency is core to Pepix.  
All inscriptions, all proceeds, and all community reporting are tied to one official wallet.  

---

## ðŸ”‘ Official Creator Wallet  PiZntAfTuqPEiBgovFtPJQrLZ9GTFi77xx


- This is the **only wallet** used for Pepix inscriptions.  
- No hidden wallets, no side addresses.  
- Every transaction can be independently verified on-chain.  

---

## ðŸ’° How Funds Are Managed  

- **50% of all Pepix sales** are **earmarked for inscription fees**.  
- These funds remain inside the **Creator Wallet** until used for:  
  - Pepix image + text inscriptions  
  - Covering base chain costs associated with Pepix growth  
- Earmarked funds are **never diverted** for personal use or off-chain spending.  
- In many cases, **more than 50%** of proceeds may be committed if inscription fees rise.  

---

## âœ… What This Means for Holders  

- You can independently verify that proceeds from Pepix sales are being recycled back into the project.  
- This ensures that Pepix growth does not rely on outside funding or stealth mints.  
- Every Pepix you purchase directly contributes to sustaining and expanding the collection.  

---

## ðŸ”® Next Steps  

1. **Community Council Oversight**  
   - After 15 Pepix holders are verified, a council will be elected.  
   - The council will serve as observers of the Creator Wallet and all associated inscriptions.  

2. **Multi-Sig Transition**  
   - After council election, the Creator Wallet will migrate to a **multi-signature wallet** structure.  
   - This ensures that no single party can act unilaterally.  

3. **Auto-Split Mechanics (Future)**  
   - If supported by the Pepecoin network, inscription proceeds may be directed into **auto-split wallets**:  
     - A portion directly earmarked for inscription fees  
     - A portion for creator sustainability  
   - This will automate trust and remove even more room for doubt.

- **50%+ of proceeds** always reserved for inscriptions  
- **Independent verification** possible on-chain at all times  
- **Future-proofing** through council oversight, multi-sig, and possible auto-split mechanics
