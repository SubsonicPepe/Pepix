## Future Allocation of Earmarked Funds (Proposal)

Following the full inscription of the Pepix collection (4269 Pepix), the 50% of sales proceeds currently earmarked for inscription fees will no longer be required for that purpose.  

It is proposed that these funds transition to serve broader community and charitable goals, potentially including contributions to the **Pepecoin Foundation** or other ecosystem-aligned initiatives.  

The exact allocation will be determined through community governance, with proposals and votes hosted in the Pepix Pond Discord and catalogued on the official GitHub.  

This ensures that Pepix remains a force for good within the Pepecoin community, sustaining relevance and impact long after the final Pepix is inscribed.
