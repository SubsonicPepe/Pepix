# Pepix Whitepaper v0.7

Timestamp: September 29, 2025 — 18:35 UTC

## Project Overview

Pepix is a limited, pixel-art collection inscribed on the Pepecoin blockchain, blending meme culture, 8-bit artistry, and rarity-driven mechanics. Each Pepix is generated from a base template with custom layers and accessories, ranging from simple (rarity 1) to ultra-legendary one-of-one masterpieces (rarity 10).
Every Pepix is a static pixel sprite uniform in pose, uniform in scale with uniqueness expressed only through layered traits, skin variations, backgrounds, and rare props. This ensures maximum consistency while preserving scarcity and originality.

## Artistic Authorship and Sustainability

All Pepix sprites are handcrafted through digital art by the creator, Subsonic_Ᵽepe. This ensures that every Pepix is designed with direct creative intention and consistency.
At least 50 percent of all proceeds from sales will be allocated toward minting and raising base inscription fees for new Pepix sprites. The specific use of these funds will be guided by community decisions, ensuring that growth and expansion remain sustainable and aligned with collector interests.

## Minting and Inscription Fees

Base Inscription Fee (Image + Cryptic Text): 420 PEPE
Includes: Pepix artwork + associated cryptic inscription permanently etched on-chain.
Ultra-legendary traits are locked permanently after first use (never reused).

## Trait System

Accessories Pool: Hats, Spectacles, Necklaces, Cigarettes, Tops (hoodie, robe, t-shirt, sweater, etc.)
Backgrounds: Flat colors, gradients, patterns, or unique cosmic backdrops
Skin Tones: Base green + rare variants (neon glow, shadow black, radiant gold, etc.)
Props: Static external objects (staves, weapons, companions, etc.)
Eyes and Expressions: Neutral, sleepy, angry, glowing, laughing, etc.
Ultra-Legendary Rule: Any trait used in a Pepix 10/10 rarity is permanently retired and cannot be reused.

## Verification and Provenance

Genuine Pepix are only inscribed through the Pepix Creator Address:
PiZntAfTuqPEiBgovFtPJQrLZ9GTFi77xx
Every Pepix consists of:
1. The image file inscription
2. The cryptic text inscription
Both are permanently on-chain and verifiable through the Creator Address.

Verification Process (Updated v0.7)
To gain the Pepix Holder role and access to exclusive community channels:

1. Send a dust transaction (0.001 PEPE) from the wallet that holds your Pepix to the Creator Wallet.
2. Include memo in this format:
   PEPIX-VERIFY-<PepixID>-<discord>-<nonce>
   Example:
   PEPIX-VERIFY-Pepix7-@CoolFrog#1234-ax92k
3. Post the TxID in the #verification channel.
4. The Creator team will manually verify:
   - Tx originates from the Pepix holder’s wallet
   - Memo matches Pepix ID + Discord handle
5. Once verified, you will be granted the Pepix Holder role.

TL;DR
Send 0.001 PEPE to Creator Wallet with memo PEPIX-VERIFY-<ID>-<discord>-<nonce>, post TxID in #verification, and get your role.

This process ensures secure, on-chain verifiable ownership without file transfers or phishing risk. All verifications are performed manually by the Creator team at this stage.

## Supply and Governance

The Pepix supply will be capped at 4,269 Pepix sprites and their matching text inscriptions. This cap does not include honorary Pepix sprites, which are gifted directly from the Creator Wallet and require no verification.
The timeline for filling this supply will be flexible and determined by:
- The market value of PEPE
- Creator resources
- Community involvement through the purchase of Pepix
If no Pepix are sold, there is no need to continue creating and inscribing more, as this would consume both creator and community resources while adding congestion to the blockchain network.
Base Inscription Fee: 420 PEPE per Pepix
Total inscription fees for full capped supply = 1,792,980 PEPE

## Foundational Entry

## Addendum v0.1

Catalogue Release
After the successful inscription of Pepix15, the full catalogue of accessories and their rarities will be publicly released.
This catalogue will provide transparency for collectors, showing both the common and rare trait pools, as well as officially retired ultra-legendary traits.
Community Governance
Specific details regarding:
- The total supply of Pepix
- Adjustments to future floor price listings
Will be determined by community votes hosted in the official Pepix Pond Discord server

## Addendum v0.2 — Honorary Pepix Gifting Period

After the successful inscription of Pepix15, and before Pepix16, there will be a period of gifting several rarity 8–10 Pepix to key Pepecoin community members including founders, developers, and moderators (1 each, customizable upon request).
Rules:
- Honorary Pepix are non-transferable and excluded from the collectible supply
- Any attempt to sell or transfer an honorary Pepix will result in both the Pepix and the original holder being blacklisted from the catalogue
- The gifting period will last 30 days from the timestamp of Pepix15
- First 14 days: eligible members must respond via Discord/X to redeem and customize
- Remaining 16 days: Pepix will be handcrafted and inscribed
- All unsold Pepix from the Creator Wallet will be unlisted during this period

## Addendum v0.3 — Weighted Collector Voting

Community votes on project direction, inscription fees, and floor prices will be weighted based on total Pepix collection value held by each collector.
- The top 5 Pepix by rarity in a collection will count at full weight
- All other Pepix in the collection will be weighted at 50 percent value
This anti-whale mechanism ensures that major collectors maintain influence but cannot dominate decision-making at the expense of broader community input.

## Addendum v0.4 — Initial Deposit

The initial inscription fees for Pepix2–15 and 10–15 honorary Pepix were deposited up front by the artist, Subsonic_Ᵽepe, to guarantee the early growth of the collection.

Deposit TxID:
8f34622eccafc5aa4eb2d69119081b83372493cf9c84879bc66d398ef5aef1fe

Deposit amount: 420 PEPE x 30 inscriptions
Purpose: Covering inscription fees for Pepix2–15 and the honorary Pepix gifting period.
This deposit is verifiable on-chain and demonstrates the creator’s personal commitment to sustaining Pepix through its early stages.
