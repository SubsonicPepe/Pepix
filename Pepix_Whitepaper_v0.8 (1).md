# Pepix Whitepaper v0.8
**Timestamp:** 2025-09-30 00:46:29 UTC

---

## Project Overview
Pepix is a limited, pixel-art collection inscribed on the Pepecoin blockchain, blending meme culture, 8-bit artistry, and rarity-driven mechanics. Each Pepix is generated from a base template with custom layers and accessories, ranging from simple (rarity 1) to ultra-legendary one-of-one masterpieces (rarity 10).

Every Pepix is a static pixel sprite — uniform in pose, uniform in scale — with uniqueness expressed only through layered traits, skin variations, backgrounds, and rare props. This ensures maximum consistency while preserving scarcity and originality.

---

## Artistic Authorship and Sustainability
All Pepix are handcrafted via digital art by the creator, Subsonic_Ᵽepe.  
At least 50% of all proceeds of sales will go toward minting and raising base inscription fees for new Pepix sprites as the community sees fit.

---

## Minting and Inscription Fees
- **Base Inscription Fee (Image + Cryptic Text):** 420 PEPE  
Includes: Pepix artwork + associated cryptic inscription permanently etched on-chain.  
- Ultra-legendary traits are locked permanently after first use (never reused).

## Verification and Provenance
Genuine Pepix are only inscribed through the Pepix Creator Address:  
```
PiZntAfTuqPEiBgovFtPJQrLZ9GTFi77xx
```

Every Pepix consists of:  
1. The image file inscription  
2. The cryptic text inscription  

Both are permanently on-chain and verifiable through the Creator Address.

### Verification Process (v0.8)
Because Nintondo.io does not currently support memos or messages, verification now uses **nonce dust amounts**.

**How to Verify Your Pepix Holder Role**  
1. Request verification in `#ready2verify` (format: `PEPIX-VERIFY-<PepixID>-<DiscordHandle>`).  
   Example: `PEPIX-VERIFY-Pepix7-@CoolFrog#1234`  
2. A team member assigns you a unique nonce dust amount in PEPE.  
3. Send that nonce dust amount from the wallet holding your Pepix to the Creator Wallet.  
4. Post the TxID in `#verification`.  
5. Once confirmed, you’ll be granted the **Pepix Holder** role.  

**Notes**  
- No private keys or seed phrases are ever required.  
- Verification is manual and on-chain verifiable.  
- Dust amounts are trivial, proof-only.

## Supply and Governance
The Pepix collection supply is permanently capped at **4,269 Pepix** (plus matching text inscriptions). Honorary Pepix from the gifting period are separate and verifiable. This cap will never increase or decrease.

Collectors’ voting power is weighted:  
- Top 5 Pepix (by rarity) at full value  
- Remainder at 50% value  

### Future Expansion: Decentralized Creation
After **Pepix420**, new creators may join under strict rules (private Discord channel). They will:  
- Use the base Pepix file and official catalogue of props  
- Follow size and format standards  
- Pay base inscription fees  

Submissions must include TxIDs for review by the advisory council/creator before being added to the **#pepix-master-list** and official GitHub catalogue.  

**Rules:**  
- Supply cap (4,269) remains unchanged  
- Pepix beyond this are **Novelty Pepix** (not catalogued)  
- Honorary Pepix remain distinct and verifiable
