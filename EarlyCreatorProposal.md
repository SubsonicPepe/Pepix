## Addendum Proposal v0.1.1 — Early Creator Program

### Overview
Following the successful inscription of **Pepix69** and the formation of the **Pepix Advisory Council**, the Pepix project may introduce a limited **Early Creator Program**.  
This program is designed to decentralize Pepix creation, expand the catalogue responsibly, and empower select community members to contribute directly to the collection while maintaining artistic and technical standards.

### Application Process
- Submissions for Early Creator status will open only after Pepix69 has been successfully inscribed on-chain.  
- Interested members must complete an **application process** (to be drafted and published in the Pepix Pond Discord).  
- Applications will require a demonstration of pixel-art proficiency and an understanding of Pepix standards (scale, brush size, layering, backgrounds, etc).  

### Buy-In Commitment
- Approved applicants will be asked to provide a **500,000 PEPE buy-in fee** to the Pepix Creator Wallet.  
- This fee is intended to:  
  - Demonstrate commitment and seriousness.  
  - Contribute to the Pepix treasury for inscription fees and community resources.  

### Creator Rights & Responsibilities
- Approved Early Creators will receive:  
  - Access to the **Pepix Creation Kit** (base Pepix sprite, non-retired traits catalogue, and guidelines).  
  - Their **wallet address whitelisted** as an official Pepix creator (publicly verifiable).  
- All Pepix created by Early Creators:  
  - Must conform to existing Pepix standards and catalogue rules.  
  - Must be submitted to the Advisory Council for approval prior to catalogue inclusion.  
  - Will not increase the supply cap of 4269 Pepix (cap remains immutable).  

### Governance
- The Advisory Council will oversee:  
  - Reviewing Early Creator applications.  
  - Approving or denying Pepix submissions from Early Creators.  
  - Revoking status if Pepix standards are repeatedly violated.  
- Council votes will determine if and when new Early Creator slots are opened.  

### Purpose & Alignment
- This proposal ensures decentralization without sacrificing quality.  
- The delay until Pepix69 allows time for:  
  - The catalogue of traits and props to be fully fleshed out.  
  - Clear examples of Pepix standards to be showcased through existing inscriptions.  
- The program strengthens Pepix’s long-term sustainability and community ownership while safeguarding artistic integrity.
