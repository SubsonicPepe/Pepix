Transparency is core to Pepix.

## ðŸ”‘ Official Creator Wallet  PiZntAfTuqPEiBgovFtPJQrLZ9GTFi77xx


- This is the **only wallet** used for Pepix inscriptions.  
- No hidden wallets, no side addresses.  
- Every transaction can be independently verified on-chain.

## ðŸ’° How Funds Are Managed  

- **50% of all Pepix sales** are **earmarked for inscription fees**.  
- These funds remain inside the **Creator Wallet** until used for:  
  - Pepix image + text inscriptions  
  - Covering base chain costs associated with Pepix growth  
- Earmarked funds are **never diverted** for personal use or off-chain spending.  
- In many cases, **more than 50%** of proceeds may be committed if inscription fees rise.

## âœ… What This Means for Holders  

- You can independently verify that proceeds from Pepix sales are being recycled back into the project.  
- This ensures that Pepix growth does not rely on outside funding or stealth mints.  
- Every Pepix you purchase directly contributes to sustaining and expanding the collection.

## ðŸ”® Next Steps  

1. **Community Council Oversight**  
   - After 15 Pepix holders are verified, a council will be elected.  
   - The council will serve as observers of the Creator Wallet and all associated inscriptions.  

2. **Multi-Sig Transition**  
   - After council election, the Creator Wallet will migrate to a **multi-signature wallet** structure.  
   - This ensures that no single party can act unilaterally.  

3. **Auto-Split Mechanics (Future)**  
   - If supported by the Pepecoin network, inscription proceeds may be directed into **auto-split wallets**:  
     - A portion directly earmarked for inscription fees  
     - A portion for creator sustainability  
   - This will automate trust and remove even more room for doubt.
